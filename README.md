# Honeycore Saga: A Metal-Fueled Epic

Welcome to the Honeycore Saga project, where creative narrative meets
Docker-based development. This project blends compressed narrative
content with a Docker containerized environment, complete with Python
virtual environments and automated scripts.

## Overview

The Honeycore Saga project merges a metal-infused narrative with modern
Docker-based development. The narrative, stored in compressed form in a
TOML file, is accompanied by ASCII art elements, Docker configuration, and
utility scripts for interacting with the content. The project also
incorporates custom file annotation rules in its scripts.

## Repository Structure

... NOTE: copilot burped here ...

honeycore_saga/ ├── honeycore_saga.toml       # TOML config (narratives, ASCII art, Docker config, │                             # and version info) ├── generate_dockerfile.py    # Python script to generate the Dockerfile. ├── build_container.sh        # Script to build the Docker container. ├── run_container.sh          # Script to run the container with a dev folder mount. ├── enter_container.sh        # Script to enter the running container. ├── README.md                 # This file. └── dev/                      # Dev folder mounting host files into the container.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** – Refer to [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- **Python 3** – Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- The `toml` Python package is required. Install it via:

```bash
pip install toml


Setup
- Clone the repository:git clone <repository_url>

- Change directory to the project root:cd honeycore_saga

- Generate the Dockerfile:python3 generate_dockerfile.py



Usage
Running the Docker Container
- Build the Container./build_container.sh

- Run the Container with Mounted Dev Folder./run_container.sh

- Enter the Container Interactively./enter_container.sh


Interactive Content Deployment
- The project enables interactive decompression of narrative and ASCII art from the honeycore_saga.toml file. This file is segmented into sections such as [session] for narrative and [ascii_art] for visual elements.
- Refer to the provided scripts for custom interactions with this content.


Docker Operations
The Docker configuration is defined in the [docker] section of the honeycore_saga.toml file:
- Base Image: ubuntu:latest
- Python Version: 3.11
- Virtual Environment: Created in /app with the designated venv name.
- Dev Folder: The host’s ./dev folder is mounted to /dev/honeycore in the container.


Scripts and Configuration
TOML Configuration
honeycore_saga.toml contains the following sections:
- [config]: Project metadata.
- [session]: Compressed narrative segments.
- [ascii_art]: Compressed ASCII art.
- [docker]: Docker-specific configuration.
- [versions]: Initial version tracking for the project.

Script Commenting Convention
Every script contains:
- A comment after the shebang line indicating the beginning of the file (e.g., # begin generate_dockerfile.py).
- A final comment on the last line marking the end of the file (e.g., # end generate_dockerfile.py).

Provided Scripts
- generate_dockerfile.py: Generates a Dockerfile based on the TOML Docker settings.
- build_container.sh: Builds the Docker container.
- run_container.sh: Runs the container with an appropriate volume bind.
- enter_container.sh: Opens an interactive shell into the running container.


Unresolved Questions
- Advanced Docker Options: Should we include further Docker options such as port mapping or custom environment variables?
- Error Handling: Is the current error handling in the scripts sufficient, or do we need more robust checks?
- Package Installation: Should the Docker container’s virtual environment pre-install certain Python packages?
- File Synchronization: Is basic folder mounting adequate, or do you prefer a more dynamic file syncing solution?
- Future Expansions: Are additional narrative segments or ASCII art items expected that may necessitate extra TOML sections?
