## Raw Prompt

```
all scripts should have a comment begin filename on the line after any shbang that might exist

the last line should have a comment "end filename" at the end of the file
```

---

## Restated Prompt as Understood by (chatbot)

You request that every script we provide must include a comment containing "begin 
<filename>" immediately after any shebang line (if present). Additionally, the 
very last line of each script should include a comment in the format "end <filename>". 

This applies to every script file (Python, shell, etc.) that we supply from here 
on. I need to incorporate these adjustments into all our scripts, ensuring the code 
blocks do not exceed 80 columns when possible, and the final answer includes these 
modified files along with the previously provided configuration details (TOML, Docker, 
operation scripts, etc.).

## Detailed Response

Below is an updated solution meeting your requirements. The reply includes:  

1. **The TOML Configuration File**  
   Contains project metadata, narrative and ASCII art compressed content, Docker 
   configuration, and version tracking.  
2. **A Python Script (`generate_dockerfile.py`) to Generate the Dockerfile**  
   This script reads the Docker configuration from the TOML file and creates a 
   Dockerfile for a minimal Ubuntu container that installs the latest Python version, 
   creates a virtual environment, and mounts a development folder.  
3. **Docker Operation Scripts:**  
   - `build_container.sh` to build the container  
   - `run_container.sh` to run the container with a folder mount  
   - `enter_container.sh` to enter the running container in interactive mode  

For each script file, a special comment is inserted on the line following any shebang,
indicating the file's beginning (e.g., `# begin generate_dockerfile.py`) and at the very 
end of the file, a comment is added (e.g., `# end generate_dockerfile.py`).

### 1. TOML Configuration File: `honeycore_saga.toml`

```toml

development. Contains all initial versions and configuration."

### 2. Python Script: `generate_dockerfile.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# begin generate_dockerfile.py
import toml
import os

def generate_dockerfile(config_file="honeycore_saga.toml",
                        output_file="Dockerfile"):
    data = toml.load(config_file)
    docker_cfg = data.get("docker", {})

    base_image     = docker_cfg.get("base_image", "ubuntu:latest")
    python_version = docker_cfg.get("python_version", "3.11")
    venv_name      = docker_cfg.get("venv_name", "honeycore_env")
    dev_mount      = docker_cfg.get("dev_mount", "/dev/honeycore")
    
    dockerfile_content = (
        f"FROM {base_image}\n\n"
        "# Install Python3 and virtualenv dependencies\n"
        "RUN apt-get update && \\\n"
        "    apt-get install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip && \\\n"
        "    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n"
        "# Set working directory\n"
        "WORKDIR /app\n\n"
        "# Create virtual environment\n"
        f"RUN python3 -m venv {venv_name}\n"
        "ENV PATH=\"/app/{}/bin:$PATH\"\n\n".format(venv_name) +
        "# Create development mount point\n"
        f"RUN mkdir -p {dev_mount}\n\n"
        "# Default command\n"
        'CMD [ "python3" ]\n'
    )

    with open(output_file, "w") as f:
        f.write(dockerfile_content)
    print(f"Dockerfile generated at: {output_file}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_dockerfile()
# end generate_dockerfile.py
```

### 3. Docker Operation Scripts

#### **build_container.sh**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# begin build_container.sh
# Build the Docker container using the generated Dockerfile
docker build -t honeycore_saga .
# end build_container.sh
```

---

#### **run_container.sh**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# begin run_container.sh
# Run the Docker container with a folder mount for development
docker run -d --name honeycore_container \
    -v "$(pwd)/dev:/dev/honeycore" \
    honeycore_saga
# end run_container.sh
```

---

#### **enter_container.sh**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# begin enter_container.sh
# Enter the running Docker container in interactive mode
docker exec -it honeycore_container bash
# end enter_container.sh
