## **Backburner Issues**  

Here are the unresolved **long-term tasks** that we will revisit every **10th response**.  

### **1. Set Up a TOML Linter for Command-Line Use**  
- `toml-lint` was unavailable via `pip`, alternative solutions required.  
- Possible solutions:  
  - Implement a Python-based TOML validation script.  
  - Explore Rust-based TOML tools (TOML originates from Rust).  
  - Check for TOML linting plugins in VS Code and Linux package managers.  

### **2. Fix Windows Terminal "Blue" Text Visibility in WSL2 Ubuntu Dark Mode**  
- The issue is caused by ANSI color contrast settings in Windows Terminal.  
- Potential fixes:  
  - Adjusting Windows Terminal **color schemes** and contrast profiles.  
  - Modifying ANSI color settings (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).  
  - Testing alternative **terminal emulators** (Alacritty, WezTerm).
